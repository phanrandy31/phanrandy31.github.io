        <h1>vertical noxus guide - how to force</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>

            comp is 
            level 6 - 6 noxus
            level 7 - 6 noxus + warwick
            level 8 - 6 noxus + warwick + ekko
            
            emblems change how to you play this but this is without
            
            
            legend 
            poro/ornn
            
            good augments
            anything with below 4.2 avg on tactics.tools
            (total domination bis)
            
            4-2 BAILOUT AUGMENTS IF DYING
            INFERNAL CONTRACT GOOD!
            
            stage 1 
            
            get noxus units and upgraded frontline (irelia best)
            
            stage 2
            click the good augment
            on 2-1 if u have upgraded frontline + samira level to 4 and attempt to 5 streak, always slam makeable items 
            on 2-2 if you won 2-1 and can put in a good unit (gives another synergy to board - not 4th noxus, or upgraded unit) level to 5
            upgrade your units (winning is important)
            
            stage 3
            level to 6 asap and put in 6 noxus, (generally better than 3 noxus and other synergies since you get so many stats)
            
            if you are playing on a gold inflated portal/or are super rich level to 7 at 3-2 or 3-5 to attempt to streak, roll until one of darius 2>kat 2 and other upgrades (mainly swain2/kled 2)
            
            stage 4
            in current meta if you have 3 item darius 2 you just shit on everyone since no one can hit upgraded frontline since everyone is contesting the same units and you winstreak all of stage 4 xd, we are trying to level to 8, if you are dying for some reason stay on 7 and try to hit darius 3/kat 3/ swain 3
            
            stage 5+ 
            if you can go 8, go 8 and slowroll for ekko/darius/kat, if stuck on 7 do darius/kat/swain
            position darius on low hp units/try to position in a way so you get resets and katarina jumps on their carry
            
            items
            ORNN ITEM TIER LIST FOR NOXUS
            ETERNAL WINTER (ANTI ZERI/TRIST/APHE)
            DD (GOOD ON BOTH KAT AND DARIUS)
            DFG (DECENT ON KATARINA MAYBE (NEED MORE TESTING)
            TRIFORCE (DARIUS)
            MANAZANE (DONT CLICK - KATARINA WASTES VALUE I THINK)
            COLLECTOR (DARIUS GOODE IF AHEAD)
            
            
            snipers and play something else (zeri)
            
            
            tank -> swain - ZZROT STACKING VERY GOOD IN META (IMO)
            ad -> darius (priority) - bt/hoj +2 (HOJ GIGABIS WITH IDEALISM)
            ap -> katarina - SPARK + HEALING + 1 (HOJ GIGABIS WITH IDEALISM)
            
            emblems
            
            NOXUS
            jarvan - broken guy + strategist
            ZED - if 2 emblems can fit 4 rogue and play around katarina/zed (zed uses ad from noxus very well)
            EKKO - (uses HP/AP from noxus well, if have exploding zaun = bis)
            
            ROGUE - play 4 rogue
            DARIUS LEAP TO BACKLINE RESET GOD?!?!?!?!?
            
            DOUBLE TROUBLE POTENTIALLY BROKEN WITH DARIUS KAT SWAIN DOUBLED AND WW (edited)
